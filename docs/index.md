subtitle: Solve a puzzle, read a book

Each puzzle is made from a short story that you can read as you solve it.
Download the puzzle's PDF and print it out. Then unscramble the letters in each
word. Some of the longer words might hard to unscramble, so skip them at first.
Some words could be unscrambled more than one way, like "star" or "rats", so
skip them too.

Once you've unscrambled the easy words in a section, look below the * * *
divider. Each column shows all the letters at that position in the words above.
Of course, each column is scrambled, so you don't know which row each letter
came from. Cross out the letters in that column in the words you've already
unscrambled, and the ones that are left can help you solve the last few words.

Here are the blended books you can solve:

* [The Fox and the Grapes], by Aesop - The classic fable of unfulfilled desire.
  (400 words)
* [The Feast of Nemesis], by Saki (9,000 words)
* [Luck], by Mark Twain - How a military "genius" made a name for himself.
  (10,000 words)
